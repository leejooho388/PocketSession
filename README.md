# SessionSaver Extension
SessionSaver is a simple Google Chrome Extension that allows for quicksaving and quickloading of a browsing session. This was created for personal convenience and for practice. There is still room for improvements such as sessions with unwanted tabs filtered out and a predefined session upon startup.

### Why not use bookmarks?
There is a fundamental difference between sessions and bookmarks. Bookmarks for longterm reference. Sessions on the other hand would be a temporary storage. This extensions would allow for saving of multiple windows open with multiple tabs. Bookmarks could be utilized to save the tabs but it would require multiple folders. Also Chrome seems to have a built in sessions functionality but it looks to be limited in control over the sessions saved.
